?/App is ruined with the "new" interface. Many features removed or worthless. The write in functionality is most notable, you cannot resize the window anymore for larger writing space. Using this app in split screen mode and trying to use the write in feature makes it only smaller and harder to use while multitasking. In landscape mode you cannot select write in mode because in order for the button to appear, you need to tap the text box; Which in landscape the keyboard covers it completely.
